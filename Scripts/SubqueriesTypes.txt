# An input file for subqueries.sh that generates global operators with subqueries (i.e. 'expression operator ANY/ALL(subquery)').
# This file contains the list of all the types for the operators: (the result type (Filter or Having), LHS, RHS (the subquery type)).
# The generated code is in Sources/Subqueries_GlobalFunctionsAndExtensions.swift.
